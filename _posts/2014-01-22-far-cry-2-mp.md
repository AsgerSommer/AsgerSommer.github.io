The point of this post isn't to proclaim Far Cry 2 as the pinacle of new and innovative multiplayer. Because it isn't. It sorely lacks many of the features that became expected of the Post-CoD4 multiplayer shooters. But for all its shortcomings, there is an uncut, but beautiful diamond hiding within the desert of it's now long forgotten multiplayer component. The game still remains one of my favorite LAN-games to this day. I still remember the moments playing Capture the Diamond on a self-created rendition of Wake Island with 9 other people on a LAN and somebody just destroyed the enemy jeep with a well placed shot from their grenade launcher, just before the enemy could score the final point. The gameplay that actually is there, is solid and fun.

The multiplayer somehow managed to completely ignore the wave that Call of Duty 4 created within the mulitplayer shooter genre. There are no killstreaks, no perks, no challenges. Almost nothing, as the game only has four game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmath, Capture the Diamond and a variant of domination called Uprising which is actually smarter than you'd think. That's because it gives you a reason to acquire all three capture points, in mode where the most stable option often is to just hold two.

## Weaponry & Environment

The gameplay is just like the singleplayer: sparse but open. The class system is serviceable, but doesn't attempt to become its own metagame. The lack of extraneous metagameplay and variety-mechanics like perks help focus the game on its core gameplay loop: the interaction between weaponry and environment.

Weapons need ammo, and you're always in need of more. There are no ammo packs or scavenger perks, as the classes only differentiate between weaponry and not between team roles like Team Fortress or Battlefield. Ammo is distributed through ammo crates which are placed in fixed locations around the maps. So if you want to resupply, you're going to need map control. These crates allow a team to defend themselves when they would otherwise be exhausted of resources. At the same time, the enemy can turn a place of relief into a death trap by igniting the crate. This is a great gameplay component that was lost in Far Cry 3's multiplayer. The gameplay of "resource control" was transformed from a teamplay mechanic into an individual power mechanic.

The fact that classes don't dictate team roles is what I'll characterize as "unbiased gameplay". You don't need to be a medic to heal your teammate. You don't need a specific perk or anything to help your team. Just action. Every piece of equipment that you need is available within the actual gamespace. Adding perks, attachments and killstreaks are some of the other reasons why Far Cry 3's multiplayer is actually worse than its predecessor. Halo 4 is another example of how you can ruin a core gameplay formular by adding these kind of mechanics when they don't fit the core focus of you game.

To finish off this gameplay loop of weaponry interacting with environment, we need to mention the fire and weather mechanics. Fire is great area denial mechanic and can be utilized by any class, with either flare guns, molotov cocktails or the iconic flame thrower. Just like fire denies movement, there's the weather to deny vision. It's amazing to see the difference in gameplay when a sniper-heavy map is filled with fog and rain. This is another thing that should be expanded in a true successor. There's tons of things that could be added: rivers that could flood, roads that could become mud-traps, actual storms with thunder and lightning.

## Improving the Formula

In addition to an expanded weather system, there are a lot of other things that could be improved in a true successor to this rough diamond. More gameplay modes and more customization for them would be perfect. The game already has an amazing level editor, but the lack of gameplay customization seriously handicaps it. Modding tools are also a sorely missing feature.

Though there's several "innovations" that this game doesn't need, a few things could be gained from the wave of modern shooters. Battlefieldian destruction and "levolution", and its spotting and suppression systems could be a great fit for a game like Far Cry. Vaulting and leaning over objects might also help improve the "game feel" a bit, and would complement the existing ability to slide.

In general, a more dynamic environment and more ways to interact with it would greatly improve the gameplay. Secondary objectives, like radio towers (a nod to Far Cry 3), radio jammers, and other things could also provide interesting tactical oppurtunities and emphasize the fact that map control is important.

Finally, I've had an idea on how to incorporate interrogation into a multiplayer game. Just like teammates are able to revive fallen comrades, so should enemies be able to interrogate them, to reveal things like locations of enemies. This way even downed enemies become an asset worth protecting, and will encourage further teamplay.

## What's Next?

For my next blog post, I'll go through one of my original maps in the Far Cry 2 Map Pack that I've made.
