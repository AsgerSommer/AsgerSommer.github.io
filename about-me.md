# About Me

Asger Sommer is a young guy living, studying and thinking about everything, somewhere around a little kingdom called Denmark. He has done many an untold feats, too *daring* and **bold** to list. As a cover, he has this cool blog where he writes about the thoughts he has in the breaks between the much more interesting adventures and journeys. Hopefully one day he dares to tell about them.

He seems to share his schemings with the mysterious gaming cabal, known as <a href="http://gamesiden.dk">GAMESIDEN.DK</a>, capitalized because they can, and nobody has yet been able to stop them. 

>Muhahahahaha

Such are the famous words of the Senior Title Capitalizer of GAMESIDEN.DK.

## Projects of Mass Destruction
### Artifactor
A game built for maximized addictiveness and entertainment output. It is said that were it to be monetized, the entire global financial system would collapse. Luckily for us all, Asger doesn't believe in the evil Free-2-Play system. **Coming soon**.

### Surf Control
A Google Chrome Extension built for controlling the popul... erhm.. helping people focus their time on the computer better and more efficiently. Like spending more time on playing games like Artifactor. **Coming soon**.

## Plan for World Domination

1. Start this blog
2. Create this page
3. Commence massive propaganda campaign under the guise of "blogging"
4. Announce the release of the P.M.D.'s.
5. ...
6. Profit!
7. Take over world, maybe celebrate with a beer.
