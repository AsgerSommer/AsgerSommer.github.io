=====================

My GitHub page, made with Jekyll and a mix of responsive HTML5 Boilerplate from [http://www.initializr.com/](http://www.initializr.com/). I mainly plan to blog on it, and post links to things I've made or projects I've participated in.

The design is missing some imagery and perhaps a more colorful palette.
