Hi, I'm Asger Sommer.

I live in Denmark and attend [Technical University of Denmark][dtu], where I study Physics & Nanotechnology[^1]. Though I will certainly be bloggin about topics related to science, physics and nanotechnology, the general topic scope here is going to be much broader.

In my spare time, i'm working on certain *currently unannounced secret projects*.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AsgerSommer), and [Github](https://github.com/AsgerSommer). 
You can also subscribe to my blog through [RSS](http://asgersommer.com/rss.xml). Currently I'm aiming for a biweekly posting schedule.

[^1]: No, we're not working on self-replicating world-eating nanobots. Yet.
