Hi, I'm Asger Sommer.

I live in Denmark and attend [Technical University of
Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk/), studying Physics & Nanotechnology.[^1]

Though I will certainly be blogging about topics related to science, physics and
nanotechnology, the general topic scope here is going to be much broader.

[^1]: No, we're not working on self-replicating world-eating nanobots. Yet.

In my spare time, i'm working on certain *currently unannounced secret
projects*.

You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AsgerSommer"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 4px"></i>Twitter</a>, and
[Github](https://github.com/AsgerSommer). You can also subscribe to my blog
through [RSS](http://asgersommer.com/rss.xml). Currently I'm aiming for a
biweekly posting schedule.
