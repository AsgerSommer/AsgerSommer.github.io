Hi :wave:, I'm Asger Sommer.

I live in Denmark and attend the [Technical University of
Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk/), studying Physics & Nanotechnology.[^1]

On my [blog](./blog/) I aim to write a few monthly posts about topics, thoughts and ideas that I've found interesting. Though I will certainly be blogging about topics related to science, physics and
nanotechnology, the general scope here is (hopefully) going to be much broader.

[^1]: No, we're not working on self-replicating world-eating nanobots. Yet.

In my spare time, I'm working on some *[unannounced projects](./projects/)* :ghost:.

You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AsgerSommer"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 4px"></i>Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AsgerSommer"><i class="fa fa-github-alt" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 4px"></i>GitHub</a>. You can also subscribe to my blog through <a href="http://asgersommer.com/rss.xml"><i class="fa fa-rss" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 4px"></i>RSS</a>. Currently I'm aiming for a biweekly posting schedule.
